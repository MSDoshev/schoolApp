# School App

## Project Overview

SchoolApp is a web application that provides users with access to their kids' school information. Parents can create accounts, add pictures to the gallery, and view their children's details. Teachers can do all of that and also create new student records. Both users can communicate through SchoolChat.

## Project Architecture

The application is built using the following technologies:

- Backend: [Softuni Practice Server](https://github.com/softuni-practice-server/softuni-practice-server)
- Frontend: React.js

The architecture of the application is as follows:
- The client sends HTTP requests to the server.
- The server processes the requests and sends back responses.
- The client uses React.js to handle the state of the application.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install Node.js
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run npm install to install the dependencies.
5. Run npm start to start the application.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to:

- Add a search feature to allow users to search for teachers, parents or students by name or class
- Add a forum page where users can ask questions, share knowledge, like and dislike.
- Add a grading page where parents can see their children's grades, dispute them, and receive feedback from teachers.
- Connect each student to their parent.
- Implement comments and likes on each picture in the gallery 

## Conclusion

SchoolApp is a web application that provides users with access to their kids' school information. Parents can create accounts, add pictures to the gallery, and view their children's details. Teachers can do all of that and also create new student records. Both users can communicate through SchoolChat. The application uses Softuni Practice Server for the backend and React.js for the frontend. Future improvements include a search feature, a forum page, a grading page, parent-student connections, and picture comments and likes. The application's architecture involves the client sending HTTP requests to the server, which processes them and sends back responses, and React.js handling the application state.
